          <p>My E-commerce is an Indian e-commerce company based in Anand, Gujarat, India. It was founded by Harsh Shah in 2020. The company initially focused on book sales, before expanding into other product categories such as consumer electronics, fashion, home essentials & groceries, and lifestyle products.

The service competes primarily with Amazon's Indian subsidiary, and the domestic rival Snapdeal.[8][9] As of March 2017, My E-commerce held a 39.5% market share of India's e-commerce industry.[10] My E-commerce is significantly dominant in the sale of apparel (a position that was bolstered by its acquisition of Myntra), and was described as being "neck and neck" with Amazon in the sale of electronics and mobile phones.[11] My E-commerce also owns PhonePe, a mobile payments service based on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI).

In August 2018, U.S.-based retail chain Walmart acquired a 81% controlling stake in My E-commerce for US$16 billion, valuing it at $20 billion.[12]</p>
